# FishBuy

FishBuy is my first personal full-stack web application project using ASP.NET Core and Angular (including Bootstrap). It is a web application designed to simulate an aquarium fish store.

In this first version, customers are able to experience all main steps of online purchase process, such as:

-> Sign up and sign in,

-> Search for fish species, 

-> Read more about them,

-> Place desired products in shopping cart,

-> Checkout and place order,

-> Check previous orders and their status.

As administrator, you can:

-> Create, read, update, and delete products (including their pictures).

-> Create, read, update, and delete users.

-> Manage customersâ€™ orders.

FishBuy uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and role based authorization.
